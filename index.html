                I am a Computer Engineering student studying at Center for Industrial Technology & Enterprise (CITE)<br>
                Techinical Institute. The things that I liked is living my life to the fullest even though I can't.<br>
                I chose to specialize in the field of hardware because of one single and sole reason: programming really hates me<br>
                and i can't do anything about it.
